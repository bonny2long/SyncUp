Team Dashboard Feature Implementation Plan
**Timeline:** 2 Weeks | **Priority:** High | **Dependencies:** None (Ready to Start)

---

📋 **Executive Summary**
**Feature:** Project Team Dashboards provide project leads with aggregate analytics of skill growth across their team members. This transforms SyncUp from individual skill tracking into a team intelligence platform.
**Why First:**

- Leverages existing `user_skill_signals` infrastructure
- Provides immediate value to project leads
- Builds foundation for future social features (peer validation, team synergy)
- Low technical risk using established patterns

---

🎯 **Success Criteria**
**Functional Requirements**

- [ ] Project leads can view team skill growth analytics
- [ ] Team skill distribution heatmap across members
- [ ] Week-over-week momentum tracking for team skills
- [ ] Individual vs team growth comparisons
- [ ] Actionable insights for team development
      **Technical Requirements**
- [ ] API response time < 500ms for team analytics
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- [ ] Real-time data updates (manual refresh for now)
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] Error handling and loading states
      **User Experience Goals**
- [ ] Intuitive dashboard layout matching existing design
- [ ] Clear visualizations using established chart patterns
- [ ] Actionable insights that drive team decisions
- [ ] Seamless integration with CollaborationHub

🏗️ **Technical Architecture**
**Backend Implementation**
**New API Endpoint**
GET /api/projects/:id/team-momentum
Controller Addition: projectsController.js
async function getTeamMomentum(req, res) {
// 1. Verify user access to project
// 2. Fetch team members from project_members
// 3. Aggregate skill signals by user and skill
// 4. Calculate momentum (week-over-week change)
// 5. Return structured team analytics
}
Service Extension: skillSignalService.js
async function getTeamSkillAggregation(projectId, options) {
// Extend existing service for team-level analytics
// Maintain same guardrails and data integrity
// Aggregate without creating new signals
}
Database Queries
-- Team skill distribution
SELECT
u.name,
u.id as user_id,
s.skill_name,
s.id as skill_id,
COUNT(uss.id) as signal_count,
SUM(uss.weight) as total_weight
FROM project_members pm
JOIN users u ON pm.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN user_skill_signals uss ON u.id = uss.user_id
LEFT JOIN skills s ON uss.skill_id = s.id
WHERE pm.project_id = ?
GROUP BY u.id, s.id
ORDER BY u.name, s.skill_name;
-- Team momentum (last 4 weeks)
SELECT
YEARWEEK(uss.created_at, 1) as week,
COUNT(uss.id) as signals,
SUM(uss.weight) as total_weight
FROM project_members pm
JOIN user_skill_signals uss ON pm.user_id = uss.user_id
WHERE pm.project_id = ?
AND uss.created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 4 WEEK)
GROUP BY YEARWEEK(uss.created_at, 1)
ORDER BY week;
Frontend Implementation
Component Structure
src/pages/CollaborationHub/TeamDashboard/
├── TeamDashboard.jsx // Main container
├── TeamOverview.jsx // Stats cards and metrics
├── TeamSkillChart.jsx // Skill distribution chart
├── TeamMomentumChart.jsx // Growth over time chart
├── TeamComparison.jsx // Individual vs team comparison
└── TeamInsights.jsx // AI-powered recommendations
Integration Points
// Add to CollaborationHub.jsx tabs
{user.role === 'mentor' && (
<Tab value="team">Team Analytics</Tab>
)}
// Extend useProjects hook
const { projects, teamAnalytics, loading } = useProjects({
includeTeamAnalytics: true
});
Data Flow

1. TeamDashboard.jsx fetches data on component mount
2. useProjects hook handles caching and error states
3. Child components receive specific data props
4. Chart components reuse existing SkillTracker patterns
5. Error boundaries provide graceful fallbacks

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Visual Design Consistency

- Card-based layout matching existing CollaborationHub design
- Color scheme: Primary/accent/secondary following Tailwind pattern
- Typography: Consistent with SkillTracker components
- Spacing: space-y-6 for sections, gap-4 for grids
- Loading states: Skeleton loaders matching existing patterns
  Chart Components Reuse
- SkillDistributionChart.jsx: Adapt for team skill distribution
- SkillMomentumChart.jsx: Use for team momentum over time
- Existing chart library: AG-Charts with transparent backgrounds
- Responsive design: Mobile-first approach from existing components

🔐 Security & Permissions
Access Control Implementation
// Backend permission check
async function verifyProjectAccess(userId, projectId) {
const membership = await db.query(
`SELECT pm.role FROM project_members pm 
     WHERE pm.project_id = ? AND pm.user_id = ?`,
[projectId, userId]
);

return membership.length > 0; // Only team members can view
}
Frontend Permission Logic
// Tab visibility in CollaborationHub.jsx
{user.role === 'mentor' && currentProject?.is_member && (
<Tab value="team">Team Analytics</Tab>
)}
Data Privacy Considerations

- Aggregate metrics only for non-owners
- Individual details visible only to project leads
- Opt-out options for team members
- Time-limited data (no sensitive historical patterns)

---

📈 Data Model Extensions
New Database Indexes (Performance)
-- Team analytics optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_team_signals
ON user_skill_signals(user_id, skill_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_members_user
ON project_members(user_id, project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_signals_project_time
ON user_skill_signals(created_at);
Caching Strategy
// Redis caching for team analytics
const cacheKey = `team-analytics:${projectId}`;
const cachedData = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (!cachedData) {
const freshData = await calculateTeamAnalytics(projectId);
await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(freshData)); // 5 min cache
return freshData;
}

---

🧪 Testing Strategy
Backend Tests
// projectsController.test.js
describe('getTeamMomentum', () => {
test('returns team analytics for project owner');
test('denies access for non-members');
test('calculates momentum correctly');
test('handles empty teams gracefully');
});
Frontend Tests
// TeamDashboard.test.js
describe('TeamDashboard Component', () => {
test('displays loading state during fetch');
test('shows error message for failed requests');
test('renders team analytics correctly');
test('handles empty team data');
});
Integration Tests

- End-to-end flow: Login → Project → Team Dashboard
- Performance testing: API response times under load
- Accessibility testing: Screen reader compatibility
- Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
